# Image Difference Captioning with Pre-training and Contrastive Learning

This repository is the official implementation of [Image Difference Captioning with Pre-training and Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04298)


The Image Difference Captioning(IDC) task aims to describe the visual differences between two similar images with natural language. In this work, we propose a new  framework following the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm for IDC. Specifically, we design three self-supervised tasks with contrastive learning strategies to align visual differences and text descriptions at a fine-grained level. Moreover, we propose a data expansion strategy to utilize extra cross-task supervision information, such as data for fine-grained image classification, to alleviate the limitation of available supervised IDC data.
